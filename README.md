   # ContactMaster - Python CLI Contact Management System

   ## 📌 Internship Project (CipherByte Technologies)

   This project was developed as part of my **Python Programming Internship** at **CipherByte Technologies**.

   ContactMaster is a **Python-based CLI tool** that helps manage personal or business contacts in a **lightweight, terminal-friendly way**.  
   Unlike GUI-based tools, this is designed for **Linux Admins, DevOps engineers, and developers** who prefer working directly inside the **command line**.

   ## 🚀 Real-World Use Case (Linux Admins & DevOps)

   Since many Linux Admins and DevOps engineers prefer working on CLI, this tool can act as a **lightweight contact management system** directly inside the terminal.

   For example, an admin can:
   - Store **vendor contacts** (server provider, internet provider, IT support)
   - Save **team emergency contacts** for quick access
   - Maintain **server access details** or client records in structured format
   - Export data into **JSON** (for automation scripts) or **CSV** (for reporting)

   ✔ **Fast, portable, and terminal-friendly**  
   ✔ **No dependency on Excel or heavy GUIs**  
   ✔ **Practical for Linux workflows**
